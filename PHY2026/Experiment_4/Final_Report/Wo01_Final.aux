This shows how the strobing light source in conjunction with the generated waves produced images on the screen, placed directly above the ripple tank. The crests of the water waves absorb more light than the troughs. Hence, the bright wave fronts on the screen (shown by the yellow peak) represent the troughs of the water waves and the dark bands on the screen represent the peaks of the water waves.
